    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Students completing this lesson plan should have completed introductory coursework in geology and physics and calculus (CALC I,II) with a passing grade (C- or higher). Concepts that will be encountered that should be familiar involve temperature, pressure, heating with depth (and the associated heat sources: conduction, convection and radioactive decay), gradients, gravity and material properties. Students should have a pre-existing general understanding of the make-up and distinct regions of planetary interiors (crust, mantle, core + aesthenosphere, lithosphere, mesosphere)."

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **geothermal gradient** is the amount that the Earth’s temperature increases with depth. As one travels from the surface of the Earth inward toward the core, temperatures increase -- these temperatures can reach as high as 5000-7000 degrees in/near the core! \n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth’s internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (the initial building stage of the planets) and heat produced through radioactive decay. This heat propogates outward from the core to the mantle and crust through convection and conduction processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth isn't the only body with geothermal gradients! All of the terrestrial planets have residual heat from accretion and radioactive sources (although Mercury and the Moon seem to pretty pretty cooled off and not geologically active at this point; but small temperature gradients still exist). For simplicity sake, we will use the term 'geotherm' on all of these bodies to represent temperature gradients with depth. \n"

    "**Linear geotherm** With no radioactive or convective sources, the simplest geotherm is the linear geotherm. When considering geotherms on other planets, this is the most realistic estimation we can use because the interiors of other planets is not well known.\n",
    "$$ T = T_s + \\frac{Q_m}{k}z $$\n",
    "Temperature ($T [K]$) increases linearly with depth ($z [m]$) into the Earth at a rate governed by the heat flux  from  the  mantle ($Q_m$, [$mW/m^2$]) and  the  local  thermal  conductivity ($k$ $[W/mK]$) relative to the surface temperature for a given location ($T_s [K]$).
