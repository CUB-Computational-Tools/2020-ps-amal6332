    "\n",
    "The **geothermal gradient** is the amount that the Earth’s temperature increases with depth. As one travels from the surface of the Earth inward toward the core, temperatures increase -- these temperatures can reach as high as 5000-7000 degrees in/near the core! \n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth’s internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (the initial building stage of the planets) and heat produced through radioactive decay. This heat propogates outward from the core to the mantle and crust through convection and conduction processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth isn't the only body with geothermal gradients! All of the terrestrial planets have residual heat from accretion and radioactive sources (although Mercury and the Moon seem to pretty pretty cooled off and not geologically active at this point; but small temperature gradients still exist). For simplicity sake, we will use the term 'geotherm' on all of these bodies to represent temperature gradients with depth. See the image below for a couple of examples of planetary interiors."
